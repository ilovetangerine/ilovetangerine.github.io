                            The New Tangerine Look
                        </h2>
                    <p class="post-meta">Posted by <b>I Love Tangerine</b> on September 29, 2017</p>
                    
                    <p>Tangerine recently revamped their website and mobile app with a new look.</p>

                    <p>From an aesthetic point of view, it's a very clean flat design that litterally only usings tangerine, white, grey, and black colours; feels futuristic. Functionally, it feels a little unrefined with the changed layouts, but I think I'll get used to it. The "insights" feature is probably the most interesting, which does a synthesis of your overall banking to provide some insights on your activity. Once I get a chance to review it I'll post an update.</p>

                    <p>Well done Tangerine. Happy Banking!</p>

                    <p>Some people have asked what I use for my own personal banking. I’ve simplified my accounts to be as simple as possible to reduce the cognitive overhead of doing my daily banking.</p>

                    <p><b>Daily Banking</b></p>
                    <li>Tangerine Chequing Account: Super simple, no-fee account for my daily banking. I love the free Interac eTransfers</li>

                    <p><b>Credit Cards</b></p>
                    <li>Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card</li>
                    <li>Amazon.ca Credit Card: This spiffy card has no exchange rate fees when paying in other currencies</li>
                    <li>TD Aero Infinite Card: I formerly signed up for this one for sign-up bonus of 25,000 Aeroplan points (good for a return flight to Vancouver or San Francisco)

                    <p><b>Savings Accounts</b></p>
                    <li>Tangerine Tax-Free Savings Account: Decent for saving a small amount of money that has high liquidity. The interest rate is generally pretty low</li>
                    <li>EQ Bank Savings Account: Highest savings rate for a general bank account. It’s CDIC-insured, so it’s a risk-free return</li>
                    <p>Happy banking!</p>

                            Recommendations for New Tangerine Accounts
                        </h2>
                    <p class="post-meta">Posted by <b>I Love Tangerine</b> on February 25, 2017</p>
                    <p>One question that comes up is which new banking accounts work best for your needs. If you’re considering opening an account with Tangerine, you have a few different options: savings accounts, chequing accounts, credit cards, RSP accounts, TFSA accounts, and so on. It can be confusing. So, what’s best? </p>
                    <p>Short answer: Start with a Tangerine Chequing Account. This is a very simple and flexible account that acts as your “work horse” for all your banking. Direct deposits from your employer can be deposited directly, and you can easily sign up for all the other types of accounts easily.</p>
                    <p>After you sign up for your chequing account, I’d suggest that the next easiest step is getting a Tangerine Tax-Free Savings Account (assuming you haven’t maximized your contributions for the year). This provides an easy risk free return.</p>
                    <p>For credit cards, honestly it depends on your personal banking situation and how much you want to optimize versus simplify. If you want to do all your banking in one place, the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card is a great option (I have one). It doesn’t have any fees, and gives you 1% cash back (2% for certain money categories). Other banks have great sign-up bonuses for their credit cards, so depending on your spending habits these might be better for you. Just watch out for annual fees, and make sure you pay your bills on time!<p>
                    <p>These are the basic accounts I’d suggest starting out with. The Tangerine Referral Code works for new chequing or savings accounts - as far as I know you won’t get $50 for signing up for credit cards (but then again, there’s no reason to get Just the credit card with Tangerine since it’s more of an add-on product).</p>
                    <p>Hope this is helpful!</p>

                    <p><b>Other Account Considerations:</b></p>
                    <p>Tangerine US$ Savings Account: Great for frequent travel to the US since you can store US dollars and exchange CDN for cheap.</p>
                    <p>Tangerine Investment Fund Account: Decent couch potato investing. It comes with a cost greater than other self-service products, but you don’t have to think about doing any investing.<p>

                            Tangerine Currency Conversion Tips
                        </h2>
                    <p class="post-meta">Posted by <b>I Love Tangerine</b> on February 20, 2017</p>
                    <p>Last year I was traveling abroad and was wondering the best way of converting money. Naturally, the safest option was converting a bunch of CAD to USD while I was in the country, then further convert it later to the local currency.</p>
                    <p>I did this, but actually found that doing ATM deposits from the local ABMs with my Tangerine card was cheap and convenient.</p>
                    <p>Depending on which country you’re going to there’ll be different fees, but in general it’s a $1 fee. Here’s a list that some other Tangerine users compiled: http://forums.redflagdeals.com/tangerine-international-fee-free-atm-access-list-1885673/</p>
                    <p>Tangerine is great for travelling abroad!</p>
