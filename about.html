                            Recommendations for New Tangerine Accounts
                        </h2>
                    <p class="post-meta">Posted by <b>I Love Tangerine</b> on February 25, 2017</p>
                    <p>One question that comes up is which new banking accounts work best for your needs. If you’re considering opening an account with Tangerine, you have a few different options: savings accounts, chequing accounts, credit cards, RSP accounts, TFSA accounts, and so on. It can be confusing. So, what’s best? </p>
                    <p>Short answer: Start with a Tangerine Chequing Account. This is a very simple and flexible account that acts as your “work horse” for all your banking. Direct deposits from your employer can be deposited directly, and you can easily sign up for all the other types of accounts easily.</p>
                    <p>After you sign up for your chequing account, I’d suggest that the next easiest step is getting a Tangerine Tax-Free Savings Account (assuming you haven’t maximized your contributions for the year). This provides an easy risk free return.</p>
                    <p>For credit cards, honestly it depends on your personal banking situation and how much you want to optimize versus simplify. If you want to do all your banking in one place, the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card is a great option (I have one). It doesn’t have any fees, and gives you 1% cash back (2% for certain money categories). Other banks have great sign-up bonuses for their credit cards, so depending on your spending habits these might be better for you. Just watch out for annual fees, and make sure you pay your bills on time!<p>
                    <p>These are the basic accounts I’d suggest starting out with. The Tangerine Referral Code works for new chequing or savings accounts - as far as I know you won’t get $50 for signing up for credit cards (but then again, there’s no reason to get Just the credit card with Tangerine since it’s more of an add-on product).</p>
                    <p>Hope this is helpful!</p>

                    <p><b>Other Account Considerations:</b></p>
                    <p>Tangerine US$ Savings Account: Great for frequent travel to the US since you can store US dollars and exchange CDN for cheap.</p>
                    <p>Tangerine Investment Fund Account: Decent couch potato investing. It comes with a cost greater than other self-service products, but you don’t have to think about doing any investing.<p>

                            Tangerine Currency Conversion Tips
                        </h2>
                    <p class="post-meta">Posted by <b>I Love Tangerine</b> on February 20, 2017</p>
                    <p>Last year I was traveling abroad and was wondering the best way of converting money. Naturally, the safest option was converting a bunch of CAD to USD while I was in the country, then further convert it later to the local currency.</p>
                    <p>I did this, but actually found that doing ATM deposits from the local ABMs with my Tangerine card was cheap and convenient.</p>
                    <p>Depending on which country you’re going to there’ll be different fees, but in general it’s a $1 fee. Here’s a list that some other Tangerine users compiled: http://forums.redflagdeals.com/tangerine-international-fee-free-atm-access-list-1885673/</p>
                    <p>Tangerine is great for travelling abroad!</p>

                            Valentine's Day Tips
                        </h2>
                    <p class="post-meta">Posted by <b>I Love Tangerine</b> on February 14, 2017</p>
                    <p>Dating can be expensive, especially when you can't think of much else to do than the typical dinner-and-a-movie. You want to have fun and connect with your partner without breaking the bank on a pricey dinner, drinks and a weekend movie ticket every time you go out. It's great to treat yourself, but you might want to consider more affordable ways to approach dating.</p>

                    <p>Whether you're going on a first or a tenth date, for Valentine's Day or for a spontaneous Friday night in July, here are some budget-friendly date ideas for connecting with your partner in a way that's simple, fun and affordable.</p>

                    <p>Grab a coffee and go second-hand bookstore hopping, or take a walk around a large bookstore with your partner</p>

                    <p>You can learn about each other's taste in fiction and non-fiction, have a laugh through the humour section, and cozy up with your coffee and a good read together.</p>

                    <p>Cost: Less than $5 for coffee, plus the price of a book if you decide to purchase one.</p>

                    <p>Head to an art gallery or a museum during discounted hours</p>

                    <p>You can be inspired together, dig into history and modernity, and maybe even knock off a bucket list item. You might even want to head to the gift shop afterwards for souvenirs of your time together.</p>

                    <p>Cost: Depends on the gallery or museum. Look up where you'd like to go: some places are free on a certain day or at a certain hour. Most places have student discounts if that applies to you, and you can often find fun souvenirs for under $20.</p>

                    <p>Check out a live band at a local pub or bar</p>

                    <p>You can experience live music together, have a dance and maybe request a cover you love. You'll always remember the time you went to see that artist together before they went mainstream.</p>

                    <p>Cost: Cover, drinks and maybe appetizers to munch on. You can likely keep it under $50 depending on what you order.</p>

                    <p>Attend a poetry or book reading</p>

                    <p>Find out if your nearest library (or bookstore) has any events coming up and discover a poet or author. Introduce your partner to one of your favourite writers, or find a caf&eacute; or bar with a poetry slam night. Discover art and experience emotion together, get a book signed, and discuss your thoughts afterwards.</p>

                    <p>Cost: Admission is usually free or around $10 depending on the venue.</p>

                    <p>Have an at-home movie or TV show marathon</p>

                    <p>If you've been on a few dates and are feeling comfortable about inviting this person over or going to their place, put away the phones and have a low-key evening with movies or TV shows that neither of you have seen. You could start a show together and always have a topic of conversation, or introduce your partner to something they've never seen before. Unwind together.</p>

                    <p>Cost: Food (you could cook or order a pizza).</p>

                    <p>Of course, there's also the great outdoors. Take a walk around a park or cool neighbourhood, and you might see something memorable.</p>

                    <p>Every couple has a different budget when it comes to dating, but with so many affordable ways to spend time with your partner, anyone can have a good time at a price that fits.</p>
